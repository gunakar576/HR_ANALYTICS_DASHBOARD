# HR_ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD

## Overview 

This project presents an HR Analytics Dashboard created using Power BI to analyze employee data and identify patterns in attrition. The dashboard visualizes key metrics, such as employee count, attrition distribution by age group, salary, education field, and job roles, providing actionable insights to improve employee retention.

## Features of the Dashboard
- Employee Statistics: Displays total employee count, average age, average income, and average tenure at the company.
- Attrition Analysis: Visualizes attrition trends across various dimensions:
- Age Groups
- Salary Slabs
- Education Fields
- Job Roles
- Gender
- Dynamic Filtering: Allows selection of specific departments (e.g., Research & Development, Sales, Human Resources) to drill down into department-level data.
## Tools and Technologies Used:
- Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- HR Dataset: The data source used to analyze employee demographics, job roles, salaries, and attrition trends.
- Ms Excel: For preprocessing or cleaning the dataset before importing into Power BI (if applicable).

  ## Purpose of the Dashboard:
This dashboard is designed to help HR teams and organizational leaders:
- Identify key drivers of employee attrition.
- Recognize trends and patterns affecting employee turnover.
- Formulate strategies for improving employee satisfaction and retention.

1. **General Employee Metrics:**
   - Total number of employees: **961**
   - Average age of employees: **37 years**
   - Average income per employee: **6.3K**
   - Average years at the company: **6.9 years**
   - Total attrition count: **133 employees**

2. **Attrition Analysis:**
   - **Attrition by Age Group:**
     - Highest attrition is in the **26-35 age group** (67 employees, 50% of total attrition).
     - The **18-25 age group** follows with 24 employees leaving, while attrition sharply declines in older age groups.

   - **Attrition by Salary Slab:**
     - The majority of employees leaving (83%) are in the **upto 5K salary slab** (110 employees).
     - Attrition reduces significantly in higher salary slabs (e.g., only 3 employees earning 15K+ left).

   - **Attrition by Gender:**
     - **Male employees** experience a higher attrition count (90) compared to females (43).

   - **Attrition by Education Field:**
     - Most attrition occurs among employees with backgrounds in **Life Sciences (44%)** and **Medical (35%)** fields.

   - **Attrition by Job Role:**
     - The **Laboratory Technician role** accounts for the highest attrition (62 employees).
     - **Research Scientists** have the second-highest attrition (47 employees).

3. **Key Observations:**
   - Lower salary slabs seem to correlate with higher attrition rates, indicating potential dissatisfaction or better external opportunities.
   - Attrition is concentrated among younger employees (26-35 years), suggesting possible career growth or job market competition as factors.
   - Employees from technical roles (e.g., Laboratory Technicians, Research Scientists) and Life Sciences are more prone to leaving, possibly pointing to work stress, better pay elsewhere, or limited growth opportunities in the organization.

4. **Potential Areas to Address:**
   - Investigate reasons for high attrition in the **26-35 age group** and **upto 5K salary range**.
   - Consider initiatives like salary restructuring, career development programs, or workplace satisfaction improvements to retain talent in key roles (e.g., Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists).
   - Examine job satisfaction and growth opportunities in Life Sciences and Medical fields.
